## G'day Cunts
Welcome to LethalSanity for Lethal Company! This beauty of a mod just cranks things up with some silly visual effects that kick in when your insanity level goes through the roof.

</br>

## What's the Go?

This mod allows you to control how and when this effects occur depending on your sanity levels. How to? Well.
- **Is it Enabled?**: You can turn each effect on or off like a light switch, no big deal.

- **Sanity Thresholds**: Set the sanity level at which the effect begins to mess with you. For example, if ya set it to 25, you'll start feelin' the effects when your insanity hits that mark.
- **Offset Range**: Add a little leeway! If you set your threshold to 25 and the offset to 3, you will be affected when your sanity is between 22 and 28. Good way to really randomize it further.

## Restoring your sanity

You will not go insane without a way to return to sanity! Here is how you can regain sanity:
- Stay close to another player.

- Hear someone else on the walkie-talkie‚Äîgotta love a bit of chit-chat!
- Getting out while the sun's shining. Nothing like that sunlight to clear the head.
