## G'day Cunts

Welcome to **LethalSanity**! This beauty of a mod cranks up the heat with some bloody silly visual effects that kick in when your insanity level goes through the roof.


## What's the Go?

This mod allows you to choose how and when effects screw with ya based on your sanity levels. Here's the gist:

### `LethalSanity.cfg`:
- **Is it Enabled?**: Toggle each effect on/off like a light switch, no big deal.
- **Sanity Thresholds**: Set the sanity level for when the effect should start screwing with you. For example, set it to 25, and you'll start feeling the effects once your insanity hits that mark.
- **Offset Range**: Add a little wiggle room! If your threshold is 25 and the offset is 3, then the effect takes place when your sanity is between 22 and 28. Just enough to keep ya guessing.

### `LethalSanity.xml`, gives you more values to fuck with:
- **Ease In Time Min**: Minimum time for the effect to start showing up.
- **Ease In Time Max**: Maximum time for the effect to start showing up.
- **Ease Out Time Min**: Minimum time for the effect to fade away.
- **Ease Out Time Max**: The maximum time the effect has to fade away.
- **Ease In Intensity Min**: Minimum intensity the effect can reach.
- **Ease In Intensity Max**: Maximum intensity the effect can reach.
- **Ease Out Intensity Min**: Minimum intensity for the effect fading out.
- **Ease Out Intensity Max**: Maximum intensity for the effect fading out.

## Restoring Your Sanity

Don't worry; you'll not go utterly mad without knowing how to return. Here's how to recollect your sanity:

- Stay near a player. Hold their hand if ya get scared.

- Hear another player on the walkie-talkie ‚Äì nothing like a bit of chit-chat to keep ya grounded!

- Get out in the sunshine when it is shining. Nothing like a dose of sunshine to clear the head.

## Config

If you use the Thunderstore app or r2modman, there is a config editor where you can adjust settings such as `Enabled`, `Kickin`, and `Offset`. 

You'll also find `LethalSanity.xml` in the config directory after you have launched the game once. That file lets you go wild with even more options, so you can really dial in the experience.

`Enabled`, `Kickin`, and `Offset` do appear in the `LethalSanity.xml` file but can only be changed in the config editor thingo. It just makes it easier for me and people who don't have too much of a shit.

## Installation

This mod is hosted on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/LethalSex/). Install it with the Thunderstore app or [r2modman](https://r2modman.net/), and you're good to go.

If you're feeling DIY, go ahead and clone the repo, compile it, and cross your fingers!
